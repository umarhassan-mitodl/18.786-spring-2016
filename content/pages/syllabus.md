## Course Meeting Times

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

## Prerequisites

{{% resource_link "835a612a-d61b-4dc2-8991-97b28f61d746" "*18.785 Number Theory I*" %}}

## Description

This course is the continuation of {{% resource_link "835a612a-d61b-4dc2-8991-97b28f61d746" "*18.785 Number Theory I*" %}}. It begins with an analysis of the quadratic case of Class Field Theory via Hilbert symbols, in order to give a more hands-on introduction to the ideas of Class Field Theory. More advanced topics in number theory are discussed in this course, such as Galois cohomology, proofs of class field theory, modular forms and automorphic forms, Galois representations, and quadratic forms.

## Topics Covered

- Quadratic extensions and Hilbert symbols
- Homological algebra
- Galois cohomology
- Local class field theory via Tate cohomology
- Brauer groups
- Artin reciprocity and global class field theory

## Textbook, References, and Lecture Notes

## Problem Sets

There are 7 weekly {{% resource_link "f1147412-414c-d794-7536-7666be8049a7" "problem sets" %}}.

## Grading

The grade will be determined by the problem set scores.
